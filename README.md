There are some small python projects inside the folder which you can called it a large project(named 'test') , you can download the zip file to decompress .
the requirements.txt is the env for the whole python project(named 'test'). 
You'd better use pycharm to open the project.
use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the environment for the project.
feel free to ask questions to me.
